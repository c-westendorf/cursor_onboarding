## Key Principles

### 1. Quality Over Quantity
- Fewer, better resources
- Every resource must be tested
- Documentation required

### 2. Two-Person Review
- All contributions require 2 reviewers
- One domain expert + one governance reviewer
- No self-merging

### 3. Version Control
- All changes tracked in git
- Semantic versioning for breaking changes
- Changelog maintained

### 4. Continuous Validation
- CI/CD validates all submissions
- Automated quality checks
- Regular audits of existing resources
